This is my personal exploration of the Unreal Engine 5 to learn the game engine and its features. I'm doing blueprints and C++ to get a better understanding of both.

What I explored so far:
- Movements of a character 
- Animation Blueprints
- Events linked between blueprints & C++
- Aim offset
- Line tracing
